# **AWS Solutions Architect Professional 2020 (SAP-C01) - Notes**

## **Overview**
The material covered in these notes are designed for studying for the Solutions Architect Professional certificate. The information in these notes should (*eventually) be sufficient for understanding AWS services at the technical depth and capacity required to be able to identify or build solutions to business problems or use-cases that may be presented during the Solutions Architect Professional (2020) exam.

Please note: At this time, this is an on going project (ie: living documentation) and will be subject to change. Currently, there is no guarantee that the topics covered here will be enough to obtain a passing score on the Solutions Architect Professional 2020 exam (SAP-C01). And by no means are the services covered here an exhaustive list of AWS Services that may or may not appear on the exam.

## **Notes Structure**
The notes are broken into subject domains and when/where possible if an AWS Service could reasonably be placed under more than one domain; then the notes will A) reference the documents under the primary domain that a service falls into; and B) if there is more information that is specific to the Service under the current domain, notes will be additive to the notes under the primary domain.

> **Note:** *I'm trying to implement DRY methodologies to the notes.* 

### **Example**
**S3 - Simple Storage Service**  
S3 is catergorized primarily as being under the *Storage* Domain, however there may be specific S3 topics or key pieces of information about the S3 service that may fall under the *Compute (Serverless)* Domain.

Should this occur, the documentation that is written under the *Compute* Domain would start with a link to the 'primary' documentation that resides under the *Storage* Domain for S3. The remaining documentation that is written under the *Compute* Domain is then additive to the primary documentation. 

As a default, no links to the additional documentation will exist in the primary documentation. There are two reasons for this, 1) it would be hard to keep track of all of the referenced materials and constantly update the primary documentation, and 2) the non-primary notes should be additive to the notes under the primary domain. This means that there is probably little to no information that is relavent or useful about the service that pertains the primary domain context.
